# OpenSwiftUI

OpenSwiftUI is an OpenSource implementation of Apple's [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) [DSL (Domain-specific language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

The project's goal is to stay close to the original API as possible.

Currently, this project is in early development.

## Background

Apple introduced SwiftUI at WWDC 19. Since then, developing applications with graphical user interfaces became more comfortable to read, write, and maintain. Unfortunately, the principle "Learn once, apply anywhere" works on Apple platforms, only.

Swift runs on Apple platforms, the web, Linux, Windows, and even on embedded devices.
Wouldn't it be great if you could write GUI based applications with SwiftUI on platforms that run Swift?

## SwiftUI on your platform

OpenSwiftUI provides the API — other projects can implement the actual rendering of UI elements for different platforms like Linux, Windows, Embedded, and many more.

[SwiftUIEmbedded](https://github.com/Cosmo/SwiftUIEmbedded) is one of the first projects that make use of OpenSwiftUI ([Demo](https://github.com/Cosmo/SwiftUIEmbedded-Demo)).

## Contributing

Over time and collective guesswork, it should be possible to re-create the complete SwiftUI API from Apple.
Check the [Status](#status) overview to see what's missing or needs to be completed.

A good starting point is to get familiar with the [SwiftUI interface](#swiftui-interface), focus on certain functionality, and try to re-implement it.
A helpful tool is to use reflection (`Mirror(reflecting: …)`) to peek into SwiftUI types and instances. This reveals the internal structure of instances (properties, types, names and inheritance).

Once you implemented a missing piece, please feel free to contribute a pull request.

*Please note:*

Private methods and properties of SwiftUI should be prefixed by an `_` (underscore) and marked as public in OpenSwiftUI.
Doing this is necessary because the frontend might need access.


Xcode 11.2 or higher is required.

### SwiftUI Interface

Compared to what you can see in Xcode, this [gist]((https://gist.github.com/Cosmo/b4cd7d4c81bf09c5801459b591a322f9)) shows you more than just the public interfaces.
It shows private properties, and the body of `@inlinable` marked properties, functions, and initializers.

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/Modules/SwiftUI.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftinterface
```

### SwiftWebUI

[SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI) is an implementation of SwiftUI for the web by [Helge Heß](https://github.com/helje5).
This project's goal is focused exclusively on the web. 
It deviates a little bit from SwiftUI by taking some shortcuts here and there -- but looks quite complete in functionality and is great for inspiration.  

### SwiftUI symbols

This command prints the symbol table of SwiftUI via the `llvm-mn` utility.

```bash
nm -gUj /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI | swift-demangle | sed 's/SwiftUI.//g' | sed 's/Swift.//g'
```

You can also have a look at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Cosmo/deeece2ac8b804f4977b388bb7185b98) instead.

## Special thanks

I want to give special thanks to [Helge Heß](https://github.com/helje5). He created [SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI), contributed many suggestions to OpenSwiftUI, and helped with insights of his findings.
